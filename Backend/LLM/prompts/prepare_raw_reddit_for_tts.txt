You are tasked with formatting a Reddit post and its comments into plain text for speech synthesis. The output should follow this specific structure:

1. The title of the post should be labeled as POST_TITLE.
2. The body of the post should be labeled as POST_BODY.
3. Each comment should be numbered and labeled as COMMENT_X, where X is the comment number starting from 1. Include the author's name before each comment for context.
4. Ensure clarity and readability for TTS, without altering the original content.
5. Remove or appropriately handle any special characters (like emojis or URLs) to ensure the TTS output is smooth.
6. Maintain the original tone, especially for humorous or insightful comments.
7. Here is an example that emphasizes how the input that you will receive will be structured and how your output should be formatted:

INPUT:

{ "title": "", "body": "", "comments": [ { "author": "", "body": "", "score": 0 }, { "author": "", "body": "", "score": 0 } ] }

Your output should be formatted like this:

POST_TITLE

POST_BODY

COMMENT_1 (by Author 1): Comment body 1

COMMENT_2 (by Author 2): Comment body 2

COMMENT_3 (by Author 3): Comment body 3

...

N. COMMENT_N (by Author N): Comment body N

This is your input:
